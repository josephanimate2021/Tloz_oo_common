# Assembler for the Oracle Games
This repository allows for any oracle game randomizer to be created without having to make your own Assembler in Archipelago. All you need to do is slot this repo into your project, and boom, you got a working assembler right out of the box!

## How it works
During the patching process for a gameboy game, This assembler is called to convert handmade assembly code into text that a gameboy can read. Afterwards, the patched game will be ready for gameplay.

## How To Use the Assembler in Any Project
1. Go to Code -> Copy icon and then click it. This will copy the link you need for Step #2.
2. Open your Terminal and type ```git submodule add URL_YOU_COPIED FOLDER_NAME```. If you don't have Git installed on your computer, then this command will not work for you. Please download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Enjoy messing around with the assembler in your project. Try importing some files and looking at it's functions to see what they do. Once you understand the Assembler, then Happy RomHacking!
